# Paradigms Honors Project - A Terraria Reboot

This project is currently in development for an Honors project due at the end of the semester. Essentially, this will end up being a small Terraria remake with fun twists related to the class.

This will be difficult to achieve, as one of the core requirements of this project is that only the classes included with the base JDK are allowed in the submission (no external libraries). I'll be coding a lot of boiler-plate material as a result.

I want to submit this project and have the TA/Teacher say "Wow, I can't believe somebody coded all this themselves". We'll see how that goes, I guess.
